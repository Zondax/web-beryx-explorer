# Accounts/Addresses

Accounts are an integral part of the Filecoin ecosystem, serving as the foundation for various interactions and transactions. In Beryx, you can gain valuable insights into Filecoin accounts, whether they are user wallets, smart contract internal actors, or others. By simply entering the account address in the search bar, you can access a wealth of information related to that account.

> Filecoin has five address classes, and actors tend to have multiple addresses. Furthermore, each address class has its own rules for converting between binary and text. - [docs.filecoin.io](https://docs.filecoin.io)

To find out more about addresses, check the FAQ section on the [address converter page](https://beryx.zondax.ch/address_converter).
