# Mempool

The Mempool acts as an intermediary between Filecoin nodes and the peer-to-peer network. It facilitates the off-chain propagation of messages among nodes. Essentially, the message pool allows nodes to maintain a collection of messages that they intend to transmit to the Filecoin Virtual Machine and subsequently include in the blockchain for on-chain execution.
