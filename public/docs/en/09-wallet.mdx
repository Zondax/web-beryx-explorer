# Wallet

## Introduction

The Wallet feature is accessible via a button at the top of the application. Upon clicking, two options are presented: "Connect to Metamask Wallet" and "Track an Address".

To utilize the Wallet feature, you have two main options:

1. **Connecting to Metamask Wallet**: 
   - Upon connection, the application will show your balance, chain, network, and address.
   - You will have access to three tabs:
     - **Incoming Transactions**: Lists all incoming transactions to your wallet.
     - **Outgoing Transactions**: Lists all outgoing transactions from your wallet.
     - **Mempool Transactions**: Lists all transactions in the mempool related to your wallet.

2. **Tracking an Address**: 
   - Enter the address you wish to monitor.
   - The application will display the same information as when connecting to Metamask Wallet (balance, chain, network, and address) along with the same three tabs:
     - **Incoming Transactions**
     - **Outgoing Transactions**
     - **Mempool Transactions**
   - Note: Tracking an address does not allow interaction with smart contracts or calling their methods. To perform these actions, you must connect a wallet.
